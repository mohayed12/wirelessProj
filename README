to run the application:

1. first go to the backend directory in the terminal:
cd <path-to-project>\wirelessProj\backend

then run this command:
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

wait for instalation of the python packages

2. then you need to get a google api token

go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/u/3/apikey

sign in if needed
click on create API key at the top right, and copy the token, then go to backend/app.py and paste the token into:

line 9: GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_TOKEN"
